OVERVIEW

H.U.SLAND is an RPG game where players can ascend to become Realm Shapers, a powerful class capable of reshaping the game world.
Players' ranks, access to different areas, and ability to craft new realms depend on their position in a special self-balancing tree, called the Shaper Tree.
This game features complex mechanics for tree balancing, duels, item collection, and exploration of Isles,
all managed via advanced tree structures like Binary Trees and AVL trees.

KEY FEATURES

  Realm Shapers: Players' ranks and their ability to access various parts of the world depend on their position in the Shaper Tree.
  Tree Structures: Utilizes Binary Trees for the Shaper Tree and AVL Trees for the World Map (Isles) to ensure optimal structure and access.
  Dueling System: Players can challenge others to duels to improve their rank in the tree. Winners swap places with the losers.
  Item Collection: Realm Shapers gather items from Isles to craft new realms, with items like Goldium, Einsteinium, and Amazonite.
  Overcrowding Prevention: Isle capacities are limited; if too many players visit an Isle, it will collapse and self-destruct, triggering a rebalancing.
  File I/O: All data, including player details, world map, and Shaper Tree structure, is read from and saved to text files.
