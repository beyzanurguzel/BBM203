OVERVIEW

Asteroid Dash is an arcade-style game where the player navigates a spacecraft through a dangerous asteroid belt, avoiding incoming asteroids,
collecting power-ups, and using limited ammo to shoot asteroids. 
The game is event-driven and features a dynamic space grid, celestial objects, and an interactive leaderboard system to track high scores.

This project focuses on dynamic memory management, linked lists, collision detection, and object-oriented design in C++.


KEY FEATURES

  Space Grid: The game operates on a dynamically allocated 2D space grid where the playerâ€™s spacecraft and asteroids move.
  Asteroids and Power-Ups: Asteroids appear from the right and move leftward. Power-ups replenish lives or ammo.
  Player Actions: The player can move their spacecraft, shoot projectiles, and manage resources like ammo and lives.
  Collision Detection: The game features collisions between the spacecraft, asteroids, and projectiles, affecting the game state accordingly.
  Rotating Asteroids: When an asteroid is hit by a projectile, its shape rotates.
  Scoring System: Players earn points by hitting asteroids and surviving ticks. Destroying asteroids grants bonus points.
  Leaderboard: Tracks the top 10 high scores, saved to a file for persistent storage.
