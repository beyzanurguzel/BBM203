This project implements various image processing techniques, including basic operations like addition, subtraction, and comparison. It also incorporates advanced image filters, such as:
- Mean Filter
- Gaussian Smoothing Filter
- Unsharp Masking Filter

Additionally, the project features Secret Message Embedding using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) method, allowing hidden messages to be encoded and decoded within image pixels.

For enhanced security, the image is split into triangular matrices for secure storage, and it can be recombined to restore the original image, ensuring protection during storage.

Features:
- Image addition, subtraction, and comparison
- Filters: Mean, Gaussian Smoothing, Unsharp Masking
- LSB-based secret message embedding and extraction
- Secure image storage using triangular matrix splitting
